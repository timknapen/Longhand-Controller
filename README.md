Longhand-Controller
===================

Controller software for controlling the Longhand Drawing Machine from a computer.
Allows you to preview the drawings on the microSD card, callibrate the machine, set settings and start and stop drawings.

This software talks to the [Longhand Firmware](http://github.com/timknapen/Longhand-Firmware) on the Arduino Due.
